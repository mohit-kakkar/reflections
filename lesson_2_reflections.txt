What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initiliazing a repository means creating a Git repository. We need to do it to reap the fruits of version-control.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is the intermediate area between the working directory and the repository. It offers us the file(s) that need to be committed.
